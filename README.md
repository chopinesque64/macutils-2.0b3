# Macutils 2.0b3
Here lies an archive of the `macutils` source, rescued from the Fedora Core 5 RPM archive. This package was
[removed](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-maintainers/2006-August/msg00021.html) in later Fedorae because no one really
knew where it came from or how it was licensed. However, its `hexbin` utility is referenced in the [ResCafe](http://gbsmith.freeshell.org/ResCafe/) documentation.

## Origin
Download the RPM:
`http://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/5/source/SRPMS/macutils-2.0b3-32.2.1.src.rpm`
